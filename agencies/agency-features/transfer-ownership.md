# Transfer Ownership

One of the unique features of the Agency plan is the ability to transfer ownership of a workspace to a client Instance. This feature may be useful if you need to start development on a client project before the client is on a Xano instance.&#x20;

You are able to start a project in a workspace within your Agency instance. Once the client sets up their instance and links it to your Agency via the [client invite](client-invite.md) process, you can perform a transfer of ownership.

The transfer ownership action can be found in the menu icon of the client dashboard.

You will be able to select a workspace from within your Agency plan instance to transfer ownership:

Next, choose a client Instance to transfer to workspace to:

Confirm the transfer. A copy of the workspace will be transferred into the client Instance.&#x20;

Once complete, you can navigate to the client Instance from the client dashboard and see the workspace in your client's Instance. **It's recommended that any development from this point on be done on the workspace that is hosted in the client Instance**. Changes to the copy on the Agency instance will not be reflected in the copy of client Instance.&#x20;
